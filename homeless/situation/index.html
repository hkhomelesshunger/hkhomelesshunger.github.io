        Homeless in Hong Kong

        <h3>Currrently...</h3>
        <p>
            In Hong Kong, there are currently 1564 people that are homeless, according to the Hong Kong Social and Welfare Department. Although that doesn't seem like a huge number, it could potentially be a lot higher and could lead to different issues in Hong Kong, especially with COVID-19 in the way. The main reason of homelessness in Hong Kong is due to unemployment which leads to unable to pay their rent, following by personal choice and unable to find suitable flat with reasonable rent.

      <article class="w3-third w3-right" style="width:50%">
        <h3>
            It's not that big of a deal right?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Surely, 1564 people isn't that many, but if we put it in another way, there will be about 20 people that are homeless per 100 thousand people in Hong Kong. That's 0.02% of the population of Hong Kong! Although it's under 0.1%, it should still be dealt with.

          What is the government doing about it?

      <p>
          To be real with you, the government isn't doing anything that could help the homeless people. They haven't provided much services or other things to help the homeless people.
